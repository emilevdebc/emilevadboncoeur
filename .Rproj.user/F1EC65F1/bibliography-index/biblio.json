            "abstract": "The use of lumpfish as a “cleaner fish” in Atlantic salmon aquaculture is increasing. However, during the summer months, there have been large-scale mortalities of lumpfish at some North Atlantic salmon sea-cage sites. There is evidence that manipulating temperatures during early life can improve the thermal tolerance of fishes. Thus, we reared lumpfish embryos (eggs), larvae and juveniles under different temperature regimes, and measured their metabolic physiology and upper thermal limits, with the goal of better understanding their physiology and mitigating the effects of high summer water temperatures on their welfare. The specific incubation (egg) / rearing temperature combinations were 6 ^\\circC / 9 ^\\circC (normal production temperatures), 8.5 ^\\circC / 9 ^\\circC, 6–11 ^\\circC / 9 ^\\circC, 8.5 ^\\circC / 9–11 ^\\circC and 6–11 ^\\circC / 9–11 ^\\circC; with a range of temperatures indicating that fish were exposed to stochastic temperature changes. Hatching success was 61 % in the control (6 ^\\circC) group, as compared to \\sim 47 % and 26.5 % in the groups exposed to 8.5 ^\\circC and the stochastic temperature regime (6–11 ^\\circC), respectively. Groups exposed to stochastic incubation and rearing temperatures also had the lowest survival rate (33.7 %) as opposed to those incubated and reared at constant temperatures (66.1 and 50.7 %) when unexpectedly exposed to high, and variable, ambient water temperatures that were experienced for roughly 7 weeks during rearing (due to abnormal water temperatures in the bay supplying our aquaculture facility). Interestingly, the critical thermal maximum (CTMax), incremental temperature maximum (ITMax) and metabolic capacity (i.e., aerobic scope) of 30-40 g lumpfish did not differ between the groups, and the first two parameters on average were 22.85  0.12 ^\\circC and 20.63  0.02 ^\\circC, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Rising sea surface temperatures and heat waves are a challenge to salmon aquaculture, and the industry must endeavour to mitigate their impacts. To investigate genetic-based differences in upper thermal tolerance, 20 salmon families were exposed to an incremental temperature increase (+0.2 ^\\circC per day from 12 ^\\circC) to mimic the rise in temperatures experienced at sea-cages in Atlantic Canada during the summer, or held at 10 ^\\circC. Post-smolt Atlantic salmon exposed to the incremental temperature increase up to 20 ^\\circC gained more weight than fish reared at 10 ^\\circC over the same period, and there were family-specific differences (p <~0.05) in growth and body morphometrics. Significant differences were also detected between the families’ incremental thermal maximum (ITMax), with average family ITMax values ranging from 23.3 to 25.0 ^\\circC. Fish weight and growth rate were not significantly related to ITMax, but a negative correlation (p <~0.01) was found between hepatosomatic index (HSI) and ITMax. In contrast, the critical thermal maximum (CTMax, measured using a temperature increase of 2 ^\\circC h-1 from 10 ^\\circC) of the bottom and top four temperature tolerant families (as determined by ITMax) did not differ (\\sim28.0 ^\\circC). A negative correlation (p <~0.01) between HSI and CTMax was also found. However, no relationship was evident between relative ventricular mass (RVM) and ITMax or CTMax. Our data show that ITMax is a more sensitive metric of a salmon’s upper temperature tolerance than even an “environmentally relevant/realistic” CTMax test, and suggest that it could be used in breeding programs that aim to enhance the salmon’s tolerance to withstand rising ocean temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Edible insects offer a viable alternative protein source to help meet the protein demands of a growing population. Optimizing insect mass-rearing for food and feed production depends on an understanding of insect life history. However, supporting data on growth, development, and reproduction from hatch to adulthood is often not available for many farmed insects, such as the decorated cricket (Gryllodes sigillatus Walk.). Here, we describe the life history of G. sigillatus from hatch to adulthood at 30 ^\\circC for traits relevant for mass-rearing and colony management. Female crickets first reached adulthood after 29 d and weighed 292.0 mg mg, and male crickets first reached adulthood after 35 d and weighed 200.96 mg mg. Crickets had 7 nymphal instars most characterizable by head width. Sex was identified by the development of ovipositors in females, and wings in both sexes. Crickets oviposited 56.74 eggs every 48 h over 30 d and eggs hatched after 10.6 d. This information provides the foundation to start and manage a cricket colony, to conduct research on life history and performance, and to facilitate practitioners to make informed decisions about rearing practices or identify arising issues. We highlight ways that a fundamental understanding of cricket biology can be informative for optimizing cricket growth, reducing variability in yield, and informing future precision farming practices.",

            "abstract": "Optimisation of life history and organismal performance underlies success in insect mass-rearing. Rearing schedules, resource use and production yield depend on many aspects of insect fitness and performance within and across generations, such as growth, development, longevity, and fecundity, which are all temperature dependent. Despite this general understanding, we often lack species-specific information needed to make informed decisions about manipulating rearing temperatures to optimise insect growth and development. Here, we characterise the effects of rearing temperature on nymph to adult development and lifespan (20 – 38 ^\\circC), and reproductive output (30 – 38 ^\\circC) in a farmed cricket (Gryllodes sigillatus). Crickets grew larger and reached adulthood sooner at higher developmental temperatures at the expense of longevity. Reproductive output was similar across a range of temperatures but decreased at 38 ^\\circC. Therefore, while temperature control is necessary to maximise production rates, temperature is unlikely to affect production yield in a fixed harvest cycle provided it is maintained within the narrow range enabling both fast growth and stable reproduction (32 – 36 ^\\circC). Our study provides a fundamental basis for further optimisation of insect rearing operations and a deeper understanding of the thermal biology of this commonly farmed species.",

Thus, in salmon held at 3 ^\\circC that were apparently healthy (i.e., asymptomatic) and that had “early” and “advanced” symptoms of “winter syndrome”/’winter disease’ (WS/WD), we measured hepatic lipid classes and fatty acid levels, and the transcript expression of 34 molecular markers of fatty liver disease (FLD; a clinical sign of WS/WD). In addition, we correlated our results with previously reported characteristics associated with this disease’s progression in these same individuals. Total lipid and triacylglycerol (TAG) levels increased by ~50%, and the expression of 32 of the 34 genes was dysregulated, in fish with symptoms of FLD. TAG was positively correlated with markers of inflammation (5loxa, saa5), hepatosomatic index (HSI), and plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels, but negatively correlated with genes related to lipid metabolism (elovl5b, fabp3a, cd36c), oxidative stress (catc), and growth (igf1). Multivariate analyses clearly showed that the three groups of fish were different, and that saa5 was the largest contributor to differences. Our results provide a number of biomarkers for FLD in salmon, and very strong evidence that prolonged cold exposure can trigger FLD in this ecologically and economically important species.",

            "abstract": "In recent years there have been a number of instances where declines in water temperature are suspected to have contributed to winter mortalities at salmon cage-sites in Atlantic Canada. In addition, it is expected that temperature variability due to more intense and frequent winter storms will increase with climate change, and this may further threaten Atlantic salmon health and welfare in sea-cages. To better understand cage-site conditions and aspects of salmon behaviour and physiology during the winter, we fitted Atlantic salmon in commercial size sea-cages in Newfoundland (Canada) for two consecutive years with internal and external data storage tags (DSTs) that recorded depth, temperature, heart rate (fH) and 3D-acceleration (swimming activity). Tags were surgically attached / implanted in late October / early November when water temperatures were 8–10 C, and the DSTs were collected at the time of harvest. Although tag retrieval was limited due to some early mortality, challenges due to Covid-19 and with fish identification during harvest, the data collected for both years were comparable.",

            "abstract": "With climate change, winter storms are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity, and result in rapid declines in water temperatures at sea-cages due to the mixing of deeper waters with cold surface waters. Given that winter storms have been associated with mortalities of Atlantic salmon in sea-cages, we acclimated fish for 5 weeks to 3 ^\\circC and: 1) maintained one group of fish at 3 ^\\circC (control group); and 2) exposed two other groups to a decline in temperature from 3 to 0 ^\\circC over 3 h, and then held them at this temperature for 4 or 24 h (i.e., to provide a “cold shock”). At the end of the experiment, the temperature for these latter groups was returned to 3 ^\\circC, and the fish were recovered for 5 days. Blood samples were taken before and at the end of the “cold shock” (i.e., while still at 0 ^\\circC), and at 6, 24, 72 and 120 h after the fish were returned to 3 ^\\circC. A moderate stress response was measured after the “cold shock” with: plasma cortisol levels transiently (at 24 h) increasing to \\sim30 and \\sim~25 ng ml-1 in fish exposed to 0 ^\\circC for 4 and 24 h, respectively; and glucose increasing from \\sim3.8 mM to 5.5–6.0 mM. There were no changes in plasma lactate, indices of tissue damage, or in plasma ion concentrations. However, gill Na+-K+-ATPase activity was \\sim5-fold higher in fish given a “cold shock” compared with those maintained at 3 ^\\circC. Finally, there were no mortalities within 120 h of the end of the “cold shock”. Collectively, these data indicate that Atlantic salmon have the capacity to withstand rapid declines in seawater temperature to close to 0 ^\\circC, and suggest that such phenomena alone are unlikely to be responsible for winter-related mortalities at salmon cage-sites in Iceland and Canada.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT In recent lab-based experiments, some post-smolt Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) held at 3^\\circC for 5 weeks exhibited a range of clinical signs. They became lethargic and swam at the water’s surface, developed ulcers to the head and jaw (clinical signs similar to tenacibaculosis in Norwegian salmon aquaculture) and had fin erosion, and this was associated with significant mortalities. In addition, when fish with “early” and “advanced” stages of these different clinical signs were further examined, their livers were found to be large, pale and friable. Fish with this aetiology also had elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (indicative of liver damage), elevated plasma [Na + ], [Cl - ] and osmolality (indicating osmoregulatory impairment), low glucose levels (likely limiting metabolic responses to maintain homeostasis) and high circulating cortisol levels (\\sim100 ng/mL). This suite of physiological disturbances is very similar to that observed in a condition referred to as “Winter Syndrome” or “Winter Disease” (WS/WD) in cultured gilthead sea bream ( Sparus aurata ) and other fish species. Thus, it appears that WS/WD described here for the first time in Atlantic salmon, alone or in combination with opportunistic infections, results in lipid deposition in the liver, compromising liver function and osmoregulatory capacity, and metabolic collapse that ultimately results in significant losses.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how chronic environmental stressors shape animal development is essential for predicting ecological responses and optimizing rearing systems. This perspective complements the use of short-term tolerance assays, which overlook the cumulative effects of sustained stress. Temperature and nutrition affect key life-history traits such as growth, development rate and survival. While both factors have been widely studied, their relative impacts are not clearly defined. We investigated how constant temperature (26–41^\\circC) and dietary protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio (0.15–2.18) influence development in two cricket species, Acheta domesticus and Gryllodes sigillatus. Growth trajectories were modelled using a unified logistic equation to estimate asymptotic mass and maximum growth rate, thereby capturing the growth trajectory in a simplified and interpretable way, enabling comparisons across treatments. Asymptotic mass was combined with developmental rate and survival to calculate a composite metric of developmental performance. Developmental performance peaked at 35^\\circC but fell at thermal extremes as a result of delayed development (in cold) or reduced mass and survival (in heat). Diet had more modest effects, as performance was stable across most P:C ratios, and only declined at extreme imbalances. Notably, the performance cost of the most unbalanced diets was comparable to a 4–5^\\circC shift from thermal optimum. Our results demonstrate that temperature, more than diet, drives variation in developmental performance during ad libitum feeding. This integrative framework provides a robust approach to quantify environmental sensitivity, define performance limits and guide us toward the mechanisms underlying those limits and/or performance trade-offs.",
